              <br />
              I also took on the challenge of optimizing scheduled tasks,
              enhancing Eloquent query performance, and executing a smooth

              mobile and back-office features, as well as the API.

              Task planning was another aspect where I made valuable

              During my time at Axopen, I've been involved in diverse projects

              <br />
              One notable project involved the modernization of a website, where
              I utilized technologies like Gatsby, Strapi, React, and GraphQL to
              transform its functionality and user experience, bringing it up to
              contemporary standards.
              <br />
              <br />
              Additionally, I undertook the development of an application
              tailored specifically for mining machines. Leveraging VueJS and
              SCSS, I crafted an intuitive and efficient interface to meet the
              unique requirements of this domain.
              <br />
              <br />
              Furthermore, I spearheaded the creation of a website dedicated to
              managing virtual machines and conducting audits. This endeavor saw
              me employ technologies such as Angular 2+, Spring Boot, and SCS to
              ensure seamless functionality and top-notch performance.
              <br />
              <br />
              These experiences have enriched my skill set and provided me with

                  I undertook the development of an Organizational Chart

              Additionally, I was involved in the development and support of
