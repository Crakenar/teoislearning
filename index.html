              During my experience, I had the opportunity to play a pivotal role

              Feel-mining website, spanning the back-office, API, and website.
              <br />
              I also took on the challenge of <strong>optimizing scheduled tasks </strong>,
              enhancing Eloquent <strong>query performance</strong>, and executing a smooth
              migration of the front-end library from Vue Bootstrap/Bootstrap to

              My contributions extended beyond coding, as I actively
              participated in <strong>task planning</strong>. In addition, I had a similar
              hands-on involvement in the Wigl application, where I worked on
              mobile and back-office features, as well as the API.
              <br />
              <strong>Task planning</strong> was another aspect where I made valuable
              contributions.

              My skills encompass Vue.js, Laravel, Vuetify, JIRA for the

              Laravel, and JIRA for the Wigl application.

              One notable project involved the <strong>modernization</strong> of a website, where
              I utilized technologies like <strong>Gatsby</strong>, <strong>Strapi</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>GraphQL</strong> to
              transform its functionality and user experience, bringing it up to
              contemporary standards.
              <br />
              <br />
              Additionally, I undertook the development of an application
              tailored specifically for <strong>mining machines</strong>. <strong>Leveraging VueJS</strong> and
              SCSS, I crafted an intuitive and efficient interface to meet the
              unique requirements of this domain.
              <br />
              <br />
              Furthermore, I spearheaded the creation of a website dedicated to
              <strong> managing virtual machines</strong> and conducting audits. This endeavor saw
              me employ technologies such as <strong>Angular 2+</strong>, <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and SCSS to
              ensure seamless functionality and top-notch performance.
              <br />
              <br />
              These experiences have enriched my skill set and provided me with
              a <strong>solid foundation</strong> in web development, allowing me to excel in a
              wide range of projects and domains.

              I had the opportunity to work on the development of the new

              <ul style="text-align: left">
                <li>
                  I started by gathering requirements from different departments
                  to create a detailed project plan, following an agile
                  methodology to ensure efficient task management.
                </li>
                <li>I set up the database for the <strong>Headless CMS</strong> OrchardCore.</li>
                <li>I configured the <strong>IIS server</strong> for deployment.</li>
                <li>
                  I established a <strong>Git workflow</strong> with basic checks for critical
                  tests.
                </li>
                <li>I <strong>dockerized</strong> the database to facilitate remote work.</li>
                <li>
                  I leveraged <strong>.Net Core MVC</strong> for development, incorporating Razor
                  pages, Tag Helpers, and Dependency Injection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I made use of <strong>Entity Framework</strong> and LinQ for the backend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I undertook the development of an Organizational Chart
                  application from scratch, with an administrative interface for
                  each department.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <br /><br />
              Additionally, I was involved in the development and support of
              JAVAEE and SQL applications. These experiences have enriched my
              skill set and enabled me to contribute effectively to a wide range
              of projects.
