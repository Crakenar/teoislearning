      <p class="my-4">September 2022 - Present</p>
      During my experience, I had the opportunity to play a pivotal role in the
      development and maintenance of key features for the Feel-mining website,
      spanning the back-office, API, and website.
      <br />
      I also took on the challenge of
      <strong>optimizing scheduled tasks </strong>, enhancing Eloquent
      <strong>query performance</strong>, and executing a smooth migration of
      the front-end library from Vue Bootstrap/Bootstrap to Vuetify.
      <br />
      <br />
      My contributions extended beyond coding, as I actively participated in
      <strong>task planning</strong>. In addition, I had a similar hands-on
      involvement in the Wigl application, where I worked on mobile and
      back-office features, as well as the API.
      <br />
      <strong>Task planning</strong> was another aspect where I made valuable
      contributions.
      <br />
      My skills encompass Vue.js, Laravel, Vuetify, JIRA for the Feel-mining
      projects, and React Native, Tailwind CSS, Vue.js, Laravel, and JIRA for
      the Wigl application.

      <p class="my-2">February 2022 - June 2022</p>
      I was tasked with application development and ongoing maintenance, working
      with <strong>.NetCore</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong> technologies.
      This project, which served Enedis, required skills in
      <strong>.NetCore MVC, SQL,</strong> and involved responsibilities such as
      keeping the program running smoothly.
      <br />
      Additionally, I utilized project management tools like
      <strong>Jira</strong> and followed <strong>Agile</strong> methodologies
      for efficient progress.

      showcase my versatility and expertise in web development.
      <br />
      One notable project involved the <strong>modernization</strong> of a
      website, where I utilized technologies like <strong>Gatsby</strong>,
      <strong>Strapi</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and
      <strong>GraphQL</strong> to transform its functionality and user
      experience, bringing it up to contemporary standards.
      <br />
      <br />
      Additionally, I undertook the development of an application tailored
      specifically for <strong>mining machines</strong>.
      <strong>Leveraging VueJS</strong> and SCSS, I crafted an intuitive and
      efficient interface to meet the unique requirements of this domain.
      <br />
      <br />
      Furthermore, I spearheaded the creation of a website dedicated to
      <strong> managing virtual machines</strong> and conducting audits. This
      endeavor saw me employ technologies such as <strong>Angular 2+</strong>,
      <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and SCSS to ensure seamless functionality
      and top-notch performance.
      <br />
      <br />
      These experiences have enriched my skill set and provided me with a
      <strong>solid foundation</strong> in web development, allowing me to excel
      in a wide range of projects and domains.
